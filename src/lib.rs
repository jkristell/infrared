//! # Infrared
//!
//! Rust library for using Infrared hardware decoders (For example a Vishay TSOP* decoder),
//! enabling remote control support for embedded project.
//!
//! This library aims for to be useful with the any MCU hal that implements the embedded-hal traits,
//! and at the same time provide functionality for using it with more efficient implementation
//! such as input capture, and be useful in host applications (such as Blipper).
//!
//!
//! ## Examples
//!
//! The [infrared-examples](https://github.com/jkristell/infrared-examples) github repo contains
//! examples of both Event driven and poll based Receivers, with and without RTIC.
