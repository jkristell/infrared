## How to use it
The examples are the documentation right now.

## Near time goals
    - Implement support for more remotes of different kinds
    - Investigate if the pwm traits from Embedded-hal can be used
    - Hw Timer-Capture based example
    - Better tracer/capture application so that remotes can be
     cloned easily
    - More utilities
    
## Long time goals
USB/Network support to be able to create "universal remote control" types of applications.
