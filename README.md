# Infrared
A library for decoding infrared signals from receivers for Embedded Rust.

## What works 
 - Receiving and decoding signals from remote controls that use the NEC protocol

## Tested with
TODO: Add pictures of the test setup

## Todo
    - Test more NEC remotes
    - Implement support for extended NEC
    - Imlement support for transmitting
    - Implement support for more protocols (RC-5 and RC-6)
    - Implement support for Timer-Capture
    - More examples
