# Infrared

Rust library for using Infrared hardware decoders (For example a Vishay TSOP* decoder),
enabling remote control support for embedded project.

This library aims for to be useful with the any MCU hal that implements the embedded-hal traits,
and at the same time provide functionality for using it with more efficient implementation
such as input capture, and be useful in host applications (such as Blipper).


### Supported protocols
 - The NEC Protocol and the Samsung variant of it
 - Philips Rc5
 - Philips Rc6
 - "Samsung BluRay Player protocol". Please let know if you know what it really is called :)

### Examples
 - The [infrared-examples](https://github.com/jkristell/infrared-examples) repo contains various examples for receiving and transmitting infrared with the
  blue pill board
 - [Blipper](https://github.com/jkristell/blipper) - An application for working
 with transmitters and receivers from a host computer
 - [Tutorial 1](https://jott.se/blog/infrared)
  
## Tested with
 - Tested with bluepill board
 - Vishay TSOP382 IR receiver
 - Various ir leds
 - NEC Generic "Special for MP3" and Samsung remotes
 - Rc6 tested with a Philips Bluray player remote
 - Rc5 tested with a Marantz CD player remote
